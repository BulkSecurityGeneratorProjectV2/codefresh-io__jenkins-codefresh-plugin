Codefresh Plugin for Jenkins

The purpose of this plugin is to allow integrating Codefresh docker flow pipelines into your existing Jenkins flows.

Define the connection with Codefresh authentication token in Jenkins system config. Then point a job at your git repo and add a Codefresh integration build step. The plugin will trigger Codefresh, run your tests and report the results.
